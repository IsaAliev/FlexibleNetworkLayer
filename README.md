# FlexibleNetworkLayer
Flexible network layer for iOS-app using Swift

This project shows how network layer in your iOS-app can be built with Swift. 

The network layer separates every step of requesting and response handling process and encapsulates it in a type which will implement its only responsibilty. All objects of this system interacts with each others via protocols.
It's not completely built, I'm going to implement paging requests logic and upload/download tasks.
